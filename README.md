## General info

For this project I had to create a company of my choice and create a responsive website for said company/business. I had to do this using only responsive units and flexbox. 
I chose to go with a photographers website as it would show off flexbox's attributes best.

Please feel free to give me advice on where I can improve upon my code, I will gladly accept.
